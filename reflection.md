Setting up my development environment for Django was both a learning experience and a challenge. 
I struggled with this assignment because I didnâ€™t have a laptop, but I was able to borrow one from my classmate. 
This allowed me to start on the assignment as soon as possible. 
One of the first issues I faced was making sure I had the right version of Python installed. 
At first, my system was running an older version, which caused compatibility problems with Django. 
I solved this by downloading and installing the latest stable Python release. 
Another challenge was activating the virtual environment. 
I forgot to activate it before installing Django, which led to packages being installed globally rather than within the project. 
After doing some research, I learned to always check if (venv) appears in the terminal before running commands. 
Setting up Git remote also took some effort, especially due to authentication errors when pushing to GitHub. 
I resolved this by generating a new SSH key and configuring it properly. Overall, the process taught me to pay attention to detail, follow instructions carefully, and troubleshoot systematically. 
These challenges strengthened my problem-solving skills and boosted my confidence in managing development environments. 
I believe learning it step by step gives me a better understanding of how development environments work. 
With patience and a few trial and error, I was finally able to resolve the issues in making my assignment.
